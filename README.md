<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

Data population is done in the projects section, although I did not add thoese dummy images because they
were making the UI a little wierd. So I added the pictures which was in the design.

Data post functionality is done in the contacts section, formik validations are also done there.

To run the application:
run npm install and then
run npm run dev
